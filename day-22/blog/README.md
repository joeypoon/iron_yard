* Create a Bloging Rails Application
* Your Post should have a title, body
* You should have a proper "db/seeds.rb" that populated your title and posts when you run rake db:seed
* When you go to "http://localhost:3000" it should list all posts (title and truncated body)
* You should click on the title and go to "http://localhost:3000/posts/:id" and display the title and body
* Add published_on to the Post using a migration
* Only show published posts
